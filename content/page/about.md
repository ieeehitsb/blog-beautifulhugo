IEEE HIT student Branch is an established IEEE student branch in Haldia Institute of Technology, Haldia. This branch came into existence on 26th of February 2008 and comes under the Kharagpur section of IEEE. During a small span the branch has organized several events including workshops, seminars, quizzes, industrial tours. We are planning several more activities in this coming year. The branch aims at overall development of the student members along with serving the technical community in every possible way.
